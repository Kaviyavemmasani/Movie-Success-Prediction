# Movie Success Prediction

## Project Description
The Movie Success Prediction is a machine learning project that predicts the success category of a movie as Hit / Average / Flop using movie metadata.  
This project applies data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms like Logistic regression,Decision tree,Random Forest,Gradient boosting,XGBoost and hyperparameter tunning to classify movie success and visualize insights using dashboards.

## Objectives
- Analyze movie metadata and identify important success factors
- Perform preprocessing and feature engineering
- Build and evaluate machine learning models
- Predict movie success category (Hit / Average / Flop)
- Visualize insights using Power BI and Streamlit

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**
